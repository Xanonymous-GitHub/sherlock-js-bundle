# Sherlock JS code bundle

The javascript code from the [Sherlock project](https://sherlock.xcc.tw)

Since this project is made by others, and many years have gone, so we only provide critical security patches for this script bundle.

Nothing will be changed.

### About this code
We created a simple html file for showing the script content of the bundle.

Thanks to multi-stage build of vite, 
we are now able to build the bundle code without importing it into the `index.html` and `main.mts` file.
